# Logistic-Regression

Task: Predict whether a customer will buy a product or not for the Banking.csv dataset (description at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). 

*NOTE: Using statsmodel will give you easier access to the violations of classical assumptions.* 

**To do: **

- Apply all visualizations relevant for a discrete target variable. 
- Write your hypothesis based on visualization analyses. 
- Encode variables appropriately (try different encoders and see which one is best)
- Fit your model using logistic regression
- Calculate precision and recall and AUC-ROC

- Identify any multicollinearity etc. and try and remove problematic variables.
- Post going through basic test (p-value, vif, breush pagan) and fixing for them;
- try ridge and lasso regresssion, cross validating to choos best values of lambda for each regression model.
